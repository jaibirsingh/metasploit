# Metasploit: Exploitation

The topics we will cover are:
* How to scan target systems using Metasploit.
* How to use the Metasploit database feature.
* How to use Metasploit to conduct a vulnerability scan.
* How to use Metasploit to exploit vulnerable services on target systems.
* How msfvenom can be used to create payloads and obtain a Meterpreter session on the target system.

# Scanning 
* Metasploit has a number of modules to scan open ports on the target system and network.
* You can list potential port scanning modules available using the `search portscan` command.
* `auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp` is one of the port scanning modules and can be used to scan ports on a target system.

# Options
For some modules, the options could be:
* CONCURRENCY: Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
* PORTS: Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.
* RHOSTS: Target or target network to be scanned.
* THREADS: Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.

# Run
* nmap scan with -sS option
* **udp_sweep**:
    * The scanner/discovery/udp_sweep module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
    * This module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS.
* **SMB Scans**
    * Metasploit offers several useful auxiliary modules that allow us to scan specific services.
    * This is an example for the SMB.
    * Especially useful in a corporate network would be `smb_enumshares` and `smb_version`
    * but please spend some time to identify scanners that the Metasploit version installed on your system offers.
