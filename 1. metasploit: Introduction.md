# Metasploit
* Metasploit is a powerful tool that facilitates the exploitation process.
* The exploitation process comprises three main steps; finding the exploit, customizing the exploit, and exploiting the vulnerable service.
***  
Metasploit has two main versions:

1. Metasploit Pro: The commercial version that facilitates the automation and management of tasks. This version has a graphical user interface (GUI).
2. Metasploit Framework: The open-source version that works from the command line. This room will focus on this version, installed on the AttackBox and most commonly used penetration testing Linux distributions.


* The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more.
* While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development.

## Components

1. msfconsole: The main command-line interface.
2. Modules: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
3. Tools: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset. 

## Goals of the module
1. how to find relevant exploits,
2. set parameters, and
3. exploit vulnerable services on the target system.

**Modules**
Modules are small components within the Metasploit framework that are built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, or performing a brute-force attack.

**Few recurring concepts**

1. Exploit: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
2. Vulnerability: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
3. Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.

## Modules
1. auxiliary
2. encoders
3. evasion
4. exploits
5. nops
6. payloads
7. post


## msfconsole

* back (msfconsole)
* info (msfconsole)
* search [any part of the name of the module, target system] ----> then use the shortcut by typing use [0,1,2....] to select options from the search result. (msfconsole)
* Another essential piece of information returned is in the “rank” column. Exploits are rated based on their reliability. The table below provides their respective descriptions.

* You can direct the search function using keywords such as type and platform. For example, if we wanted our search results to only include auxiliary modules, we could set the type to auxiliary. The screenshot below shows the output of the search type:auxiliary telnet command.
* **Note:** Please remember that exploits take advantage of a vulnerability on the target system and may always show unexpected behavior. A low-ranking exploit may work perfectly, and an excellent ranked exploit may not, or worse, crash the target system.

## Working with modules
* Once you have entered the context of a module using the use command followed by the module name, you will need to set parameters.
* Remember, based on the module you use, additional or different parameters may need to be set. It is good practice to use the show options command to list the required parameters.
* All parameters are set using the same command syntax: `set PARAMETER_NAME VALUE`
* **Prompt 1**: A shell on the target system: Once the exploit is completed, you may have access to a command shell on the target system. This is a regular command line, and all commands typed here run on the target system.
* **Prompt 2**: The Meterpreter prompt: Meterpreter is an important payload we will see in detail later in this module. This means a Meterpreter agent was loaded to the target system and connected back to you. You can use Meterpreter specific commands here.

* Parameters you will often use are:

1. RHOSTS:
   * “Remote host”, the IP address of the target system. A single IP address or a network range can be set. This will support the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (/24, /16, etc.) or a network range (10.10.10.x – 10.10.10.y).
   * You can also use a file where targets are listed, one target per line using file:/path/of/the/target_file.txt, as you can see below.
2. RPORT: “Remote port”, the port on the target system the vulnerable application is running on.
3. PAYLOAD: The payload you will use with the exploit.
4. LHOST: “Localhost”, the attacking machine (your AttackBox or Kali Linux) IP address.
5. LPORT: “Local port”, the port you will use for the reverse shell to connect back to. This is a port on your attacking machine, and you can set it to any port not used by any other application.
6. SESSION: Each connection established to the target system using Metasploit will have a session ID. You will use this with post-exploitation modules that will connect to the target system using an existing connection.

* You can override any set parameter using the set command again with a different value. You can also clear any parameter value using the unset command or clear all set parameters with the unset all command.

* **Global parameters**:
  * You can use the setg command to set values that will be used for all modules.
  * You can clear any value set with setg using unsetg.

## Check paramater with exploit 
* In Metasploit, the "check" command is used to check whether the selected exploit module is likely to work against the target without actually launching the exploit. It's a useful step in the reconnaissance and verification process before attempting to exploit a target. The "check" command can help you assess whether the target is vulnerable to the chosen exploit and whether it's worth proceeding with the actual exploit attempt.

* Here's how to use the "check" command with an exploit module:

**Start Metasploit:**
Start Metasploit by opening a terminal and running the msfconsole command.

**Select an Exploit Module:**
  Use the use command to select the exploit module you want to check. Replace <exploit_module> with the actual name of the module.
  `msf6 > use <exploit_module>`
  
**Set Required Options:**
  For most exploit modules, you'll need to set specific options such as the target IP address, target port, or other parameters. Use the set command to configure these options.
  `msf6 exploit(<exploit_module>) > set RHOSTS target_ip`
**Check for Vulnerability:**
  Run the "check" command to see if the target appears to be vulnerable to the selected exploit:
  `msf6 exploit(<exploit_module>) > check`

* The "check" command will perform some initial checks and report whether it believes the target is vulnerable or not. It's important to note that this is not a definitive test but a preliminary assessment.

**Interpret the Results:**
After running the "check" command, review the output to determine if the target is potentially vulnerable. If the check suggests that the target is vulnerable, it's an indication that you may proceed with the actual exploit.

* However, keep in mind that the "check" command does not guarantee success. It's just an initial assessment. A successful "check" does not replace the need for thorough testing and validation during a penetration test or security assessment.

* If the "check" command indicates that the target is vulnerable, you can then proceed with the actual exploitation attempt using the "exploit" command. Be cautious when conducting such activities and ensure you have the necessary authorization to perform security testing on the target system.


## Sessions
* Once a vulnerability has been successfully exploited, a session will be created. This is the communication channel established between the target system and Metasploit.
* You can use the background command to background the session prompt and go back to the msfconsole prompt.

**Backgrounding sessions**
`meterpreter > background`

[*] Backgrounding session 2...

* Alternatively, CTRL+Z can be used to background sessions.

* The sessions command can be used from the msfconsole prompt or any context to see the existing sessions.

**Listing active sessions**
`msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > sessions`

* To interact with any session, you can use the sessions -i command followed by the desired session number.
 `msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > sessions`
